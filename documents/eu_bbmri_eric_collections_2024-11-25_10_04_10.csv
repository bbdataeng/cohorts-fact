Within the CRC totals, 80% is represented by sporadic forms, about 10% by hereditary ones, while about 20-30% is represented by family forms. In hereditary forms, the alteration of a single gene, transmitted through the germline, causes a marked familial predisposition to the development of colorectal cancer. Among these, familial polyposis syndromes (FAP) are a very heterogeneous group of rare diseases that, overall, account for about 1% of all CRCs.
